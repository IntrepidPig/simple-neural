# Simple Neural Network

A simple neural network with gradient descent learning implemented from scratch in Rust by following the first couple chapters of this book: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com. Depends on training data available for download from that link.

Supports saving a trained neural network to a data file and loading it again in a later run.
